# Graduate-Union
Youth Employment Mobile Application

This app is basically created to connect gradutes form universities, TVET Colleges, Private Colleges;
(Those who finished their tertiary education), to be able to be recognised by employers as possible
future employees based on what they have. To atleast get 30% of the unemployed youth to the
working environment on permanent basis type of employment.

This app will also include matriculants or youth of south Africa that only posses a matric certificate.
Graduate Union will also provide a platform for tutors who will be able to start tutoring 
undergradutes from universities and high school students, before finding employment.

This app will basically be the inkabi on fighting the unfair hiring system of this country that has clearly
shown the youth of South Africa that they are less considered when it comes to being hired although
they are encouraged to be educated, and years later seen as time wasting.
